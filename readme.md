# Alg & Dat

`Alg & Dat` is a light and head-only library for algorithm and data structure implementation writing by modern C++. User can only include algorithm or data structure header file with least dependent header file.

## Feature

- Light and Header-only.
- Most Template, easy for using with least helper function.
- Least dependent header file, most `alg` or `dat` is independent.
- Performance friendly.

## Algorithm

- `radix_sort<KeyType, Element>` : A very fast sort function to sort any elements with unsigned type key.

## DataStructure

## Dependent

Some help function or structure for algorithm and data structure.

- `allocator`: Some simple and useful allocator.
